Task1: We have created a rule based classifier to classify the transactions into respective classes + embbedding based similarity is used to determine the confidence score


Task2: We have created a rule based policy algorithm to come up with the resolutions

Task3: We have used Ollama + Text2SQL to answer User Questions 



Synthetic Dataset:

- We have use a synthetic dataset from Kaggle
Tasks 4:

    - Duplicate transaction detection based on few features like, trnsaction time, amount. It is enhanced with llm decision making and embedding based similarity when few of the features are missing

- Task 5: 
    - We have made plots to visualize the resolutions.csv


- Task 6:

    - Anomoly detection
        - The Basic Idea is that given a dataset, 
        come up with user modelling which includes user level average money spent and his history / pattern
        - For this experiment we have used his money alone to detect if there are any anomalies
